# Flux2 INT8 Acceleration

This node speeds up Flux2 in ComfyUI by using INT8 quantization, delivering ~2x faster inference on my 3090, but it should work on any NVIDIA GPU with enough INT8 TOPS. It's unlikely to be faster than proper FP8 on 40-Series and above. 
Works with lora*, torch compile (needed to get full speedup).

*You need a different approach to use loras on quantized models models. A PR by KohakuBlueleaf with a fix is available here: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/pull/11958

We auto-convert flux2 klein to INT8 on load if needed. Pre-quantized checkpoints with slightly higher quality and enabling faster loading are available here:

# Requirements:
Working ComfyKitchen (needs latest comfy and possibly pytorch with cu130)

Triton

Windows untested, but I hear triton-windows exists.

If you have a 30-Series GPU, OneTrainer is also the fastest current lora trainer thanks to this. Please go check them out!!
